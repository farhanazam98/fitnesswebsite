      <p>When it comes to fitness, nutrition is as important, if not more important,
      than exercise itself. Nutrition plays an important in whatever your fitness goals
      are, whether it is gaining muscle, losing fat, or maintaining your current state.

      <h2> Macronutrients </h2>
        <p> When it comes to macronutrients, the three categories are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Carbs</li>
          <li>Fats</li>
          <li>Protein</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these plays a different role in the body, and every food that you
          eat contains at least one of these macronutrients. I will break down
          each of these macronutrients in the following section.
        </p>
          <h3> Carbohydrates </h3>
            <p>Carbs are usually the body's main fuel source. Carbohyrdates are broken down
              into either glucose to be used immediately as energy, or as sugar which is stored
              to be used later as a source of energy. Carbs often get a bad rep as the cause for
              fat. However, the right amount of carbs from healthy sources is important to the
              function of the body. Also, athletes tend to need more carbs to provide additional
              energy for peak performance.
            </p>
            <p>An important note is that not all carbs are created equally. Although it is a bit of
            an oversimplification, we can divide carbs between naturally occuring carbs vs. processed
            carbs. Naturally occuring carbs (e.g. whole grain bread, fruits, vegetables, beans) are high in
            fiber, vitamins, and nutrients. This helps us feel satiated. On the other hand processed
            carbs, (e.g. white bread, white rice, white flour) lack fiber, vitamins and minerals. This is
            not optimal for health or fitness goals.
            </p>
          <h3> Protein </h3>
            <p>Protein is essential for both building and maintaining muscle. Protein gets a bad rap
            sometimes. Some people believe that eating too much protein can lead to a "bulky" look,
            while others attest that too much protein is bad for the kidneys. Both of these statements
            are false (citation needed). Protein is a satiating nutrient, meaning it helps us feel full
            while we are eating. Also, adequate protein helps develop that "toned" look that many people
            strive for. I would argue that animal products are the best way to consume adequate amounts
            of protein, there are definitely other ways to supplement protein, either through whey
            tofu, beans, eggs, etc.
            </p>
            <p>Once again, not all protein is created equal. Consuming lots of processed meats is not
              generally recommended. Some proteins are leaner (contain less fat) than others. For example,
              tuna, chicken breast, and egg whites contain little to no fat, while steak, chicken thigh/leg
              and pork contain higher amounts of fat.
            </p>
            <p>One last note is that protein is somewhat of a costly macronutrient to come across. A lot of
              restaurants offer dishes higher in carbs/fat rather than protein. Buying ready-to-eat meats are
              generally more expensive. These costs can be offset by buying in bulk and cooking these meats at home
            </p>
          <h3> Fats </h3>
            <p>Fats are an essential component of one's nutrition as well. Fats play a key role in regulating the
              body's hormones, including leptin, cortisol, and growth hormone. These hormones play a vital role in
              regulating how hungry we feel, our stress, energy, and fat metabolism. Not eating enough fats can
              have a detrimental effect one one's health and fitness goals. Fat is also the most satiating
              macronutrient. Eating enough (healthy) fats could help curb one's appetite. When the body runs low
              on carbs, the body turns to fat as a source of energy. This is the basis for the ketogenic diet,
              which has worked positively for a lot of people.
            </p>
            <p>Once again, not all fats are created equal. Fats can be generalized into three broad categories:
              <ul>
                <li>Trans</li>
                <li>Saturated</li>
                <li>Unsaturated</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>Trans fats are <b>not </b> a necessary component of one's diet and should be avoided at all costs.
              These fats are associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, amongst many other health
              conditions. Luckily, the government has implemented laws to limit the amount of trans fats in
              restaurants.
              </p>
              <p>Saturated fats are an important component in one's nutrition, but only in limited amounts. It is
              generally recommended that 5-6% of daily caloric intake should come from saturated fat. Amounts larger
              than are not recommended and lead to cardiovascular disease(citation).
              </p>
              <p>Unsaturated fats (aka polyunsaturated fat, and monounsaturated fat) are generally accepted as the
              healthiest form of fat. This comes from foods such as plant-based food sources, like vegetable oil,
              nuts. They can also be found in fish. Polyunsaturated fats contain Omega 3 fatty acids, which are
              for heart health.
