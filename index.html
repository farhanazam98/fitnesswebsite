		<h2>Welcome to fafit.com</h2>
		<p> I created this website in order to share my passion for fitness with others.
		With all the trends on social media, it is easy to be overwhelmed by all of the
	  information out there, and it is difficult to distinguish reliable content from fads.
		The purpose of this website is to create a simple and easy to follow guide to
		start one's own journey through fitness. I want to dispell all the common fitness
		myths out there, and to inspire others to lead healthy and active lifestyles. I will
	  also do my best to provide scientifically accurate information with citations. </p>
