        <p>Unfortunately, many people view exercise as a chore. This is detrimental to one's
            fitness goals and quality of life. Whether you prefer running, lifting weights, or playing
            a sport, exercise releases dopamine naturally and lowers cortisol simultaneously.(citation)
            responsible for pleasure while cortisol is the hormone produced during stress. This is why
            exercise is beneficial to both physical and mental health. </p>
            <p>For the purposes of this website, I am going to focus on the topic of weightlifting,
            since it is the topic I know the most about. There is a common misconception that lifting
            contributes to a bulky look with too much muscle. However, this only occurs when lifting
            weights is combined with a large caloric surplus. The "toned" look that many people are
            for comes from a caloric deficit <b>and</b> lifting weights. The caloric deficit allows people
            to lose fat, while lifting weights allows you to maintain (or even grow) muscle (citation).
            That is why I recommend weight lifting to people of all ages and conditions (with approval
            from a doctor). Cardio can also be used as a tool to aid the caloric deficit.
